# Full Stack Dev

Here, on this blog, I plan to document my journey of learning full stack dev so that I can build applications for future projects.

I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, with a lot of experience with C++, C and Python.

## Resources I'll use
I will be first learning JavaScript with MDN docs. 

[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

Started Jun 7th 2025

Then, I will learn React.js (frontend) through this Scrimba course (free for most):

[Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)

Then I will go on to learn Node.js and Express.Js (backend).

## Reasons for frameworks
The reasons for these frameworks is that they are extremely well documented, have tons of online free tutorials and guides and share the same language of JavaScript. If I develop a strong foundation of JavaScript learning these frameworks should be much easier.

## Github and Blogs
All of this will be documented through  
[Github](https://github.com/tmastercoding/fullstack) on a public repo and on seperate blog posts all tagged with the code  [fullstack](https://tmastercoding.blogspot.com/search/label/fullstack).

Thanks!
